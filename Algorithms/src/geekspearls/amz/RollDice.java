/**
 * A six-sided die is a small cube with a different number of pips on each face (side), ranging from 1 to 6.
 * On any two opposite side of the cube, the number of pips adds up to 7; that is, there are three pairs of opposite
 * sides: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, and 3 and 4.
 * There are N dice lying on a table, each showing the pips on its top face. In one move, you can take one die and
 * rotate it to an adjacent face.
 * For example, you can rotate a die that shows 1 s that it shows 2, 3, 4 or 5. However, it cannot show 6 in a single
 * move, because the faces with one pip and six pips visible are opposite sides rather than adjacent.
 * You want to show the same number of pips on the top face of all N dice. Given that each of the dice can be moved
 * multiple times, count the minimum number of moves needed to get equal faces.
 *
 * Write a function that, given an array A consisting of N integers describing the number of pips (from 1 to 6) shown
 * on each die's top face, returns the minimum number of moves necessary for each die show the same number of pips.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: A = [1, 2, 3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You can pick the first two dice and rotate each of them in one move so that they all show three pips
 * on the top face.
 * Notice that you can also pick any other pair of dice in this case.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: A = [1, 1, 6]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The only optimal answer is to rotate the last die so that it shows one pip. It is necessary to use two
 * rotations to achieve this.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: A = [1, 6, 2, 3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: For instance, you can make all dice show 2: just rotate each die which is not showing 2.
 * Notice that for each die you can do this in one move.
 * A ssume that:
 * • N is an integer within the range [1..100];
 * • each element of the array A is an integer within the range [1..6].
