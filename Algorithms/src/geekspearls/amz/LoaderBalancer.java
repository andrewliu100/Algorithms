/**
 * Your server has received a package of N incoming requests. Handling the K-th request (for K from 0 to N âˆ’ 1) will
 * take A[K] seconds.
 *
 * The load balancer has to drop two acquired requests and distribute the rest of them between three workers in such
 * a way that each worker receives a contiguous fragment of requests to handle, and finishes handling them in exactly
 * the same moment as the other workers. No two workers should receive the same request to compute.
 *
 * The load balancer's distribution of requests is performed by selecting two requests that will be dropped, and
 * which will split the array into three contiguous parts that will be allocated to the workers. More precisely,
 * if requests 2 and 5 are chosen by the load balancer from a package of 9 requests, then:
 *
 * the 0-th to 1-st requests will be handled by the first worker,
 * the 3-rd to 4-th requests will be handled by the second worker,
 * the 6-th to 8-th requests will be handled by the third worker.
 * Such a distribution will be correct if each worker receives requests equalling the same total amount of handling time.
 *
 * Write a function solution that, given an array A of N integers representing the time of execution of consecutive tasks,
 * returns true if it is possible for the load balancer to choose two requests that will determine an even distribution of requests among three workers, or false otherwise.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Given A = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2], the function should return true, as choosing requests 2 and 5 results in a
 * distribution giving 4 seconds of handling time to each worker, as explained in the following image:
 *
 * Given A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should return false.
 *
 * Given A = [1, 2, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2] of length 20,000, the function should return true.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [5..100,000];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..10,000].
