 * I wanted to let everyone know that you can't assume you will always get a question from leetcode. I just had a phone screen with Amazon AWS and here was my question:
 *
 * You have a class with two methods that calculate factorials.
 *
 * example: factorial is 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
 * input is 3, result is 6
 * Implement an iterative function that calculates the factorial
 * Implement a recursive function that calculates the factorial
 *

 * follow up: factorial of large number
